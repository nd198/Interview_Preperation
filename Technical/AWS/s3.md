# What is presigned URL
An Amazon S3 presigned URL is a secure, time-limited link that grants temporary access to a specific object in an S3 bucket. It allows a user or application to perform a particular S3 operation (like reading, uploading, or deleting an object) without requiring them to have their own AWS security credentials or direct permissions to the bucket.

**Here's a breakdown of what a presigned URL is and how it works:**
    > Purpose: The primary purpose of a presigned URL is to enable sharing of private S3 objects securely and temporarily. For example, you can allow a user to download a file from a private S3 bucket without making the entire bucket public or giving them AWS credentials.[1][3][4]
    > Temporary Access: Unlike standard S3 object URLs, a presigned URL is valid only for a limited period, specified during its creation. Once the expiry time lapses, the URL becomes invalid, and access is denied.[2][3]
    > Security Credentials: A presigned URL is generated by an AWS user (or application) who does have the necessary permissions to access the S3 object. The URL itself contains security credentials and a signature that authorizes the specific action for the specified duration.
    > Operations: Presigned URLs can be generated for various S3 operations, including:
        > Downloading (GET): Allowing someone to retrieve an object.[2][3]
        > Uploading (PUT/POST): Allowing someone to upload a new object or update an existing one.[2][3]
        > Other S3 Operations: While less common, presigned URLs can also be used for other S3 API operations, such as listing buckets or getting bucket locations.[3]
    > Parameters: When a presigned URL is generated, it includes specific parameters that define the access it grants:
        > Bucket: The S3 bucket where the object resides.[2]
        > Key: The name of the object.[2]
        > Expires: The duration for which the URL remains valid.[2][4]
        > Operation: The specific S3 action permitted (e.g., GetObject, PutObject).[3][5]
    **How it works**: When a user clicks on or uses a presigned URL, Amazon S3 uses the embedded credentials and signature to verify the request. If the signature is valid and the URL has not expired, S3 grants access to perform the specified operation on the designated object. The person using the URL doesn't need to have their own AWS credentials 
    > When someone uses this URL, S3 verifies the signature, the expiry time, and the credentials embedded within it. If everything is valid, S3 grants temporary access to perform the operation
