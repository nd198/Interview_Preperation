<!-- Redux Middleware -->

Redux middleware provides a powerful extension point in the Redux data flow, acting as a bridge between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer[1]. Essentially, a middleware is a function that intercepts every action sent to the reducer, allowing you to perform additional logic, transformations, or side effects before the action proceeds or even stops it entirely[1][2].
