# Service Mesh
A Service Mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication within a microservices architecture. It typically works by deploying a "sidecar proxy" alongside each application container in a Pod. All network traffic to and from the application container goes through this sidecar proxy.
**Problems it Solves in Kubernetes:**
In a complex microservices environment, managing service communication (routing, resilience, security, observability) becomes challenging. A service mesh addresses these "cross-cutting concerns" that traditionally would be implemented at the application level (leading to duplicated code and inconsistencies) or managed by the network team with traditional load balancers.
    **Specifically, a service mesh solves problems like:**
        > Traffic Management: Complex routing rules, A/B testing, canary deployments, traffic splitting, traffic shaping, and circuit breaking.
        > Observability: Uniform metrics collection (latency, error rates, request volume), distributed tracing, and comprehensive logging for all service communications.
        > Security: Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication and encryption between services without application changes, fine-grained authorization policies (e.g., "service A can only call service B on port X"), and secure access for external services.
        > Resilience/Reliability: Automatic retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, and rate limiting to improve the fault tolerance of services.
        > Policy Enforcement: Centralized enforcement of policies regarding communication patterns and resource usage.
    **Examples of Functionalities a Service Mesh Provides:**
        **Traffic Routing**:
        > Route 5% of traffic to a new version (canary deployment).
        > Route all traffic from specific users/IPs to a beta version.
        > URL-based routing (e.g., /api/v1 to service-v1, /api/v2 to service-v2).
        > Load Balancing: Advanced load balancing algorithms (e.g., least requests, consistent hashing) beyond what a basic Kubernetes Service offers.
        > Circuit Breaking: Automatically stop sending requests to an unhealthy service to prevent **cascading failures.**
        > Retries and Timeouts: Configure intelligent retries and timeouts for inter-service calls.
        > Mutual TLS (mTLS): Automatically encrypts and authenticates all traffic between services, creating a secure communication channel.
        > Access Control: Define granular authorization policies (e.g., service-frontend can call service-backend but not service-database).
        > Distributed Tracing: Generate and propagate trace IDs to track requests across multiple services, simplifying debugging.
        > Metrics Collection: Automatically collect service-level metrics (e.g., request count, success rate, latency percentiles) for all proxied traffic.
