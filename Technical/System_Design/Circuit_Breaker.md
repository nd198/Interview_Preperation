**1. Circuit Breaker Pattern**
The Circuit Breaker pattern is a design pattern used to prevent cascading failures in a distributed system. When a service (let's call it Service A) makes requests to another service (Service B), and Service B becomes unavailable or starts responding slowly, Service A might keep retrying the request. This can exhaust resources in Service A, leading to its own failure, and potentially a cascading failure throughout the system.
The circuit breaker acts like an electrical circuit breaker: if an operation fails repeatedly, it "trips" the circuit, preventing further calls to the failing service. This gives the failing service time to recover and prevents the calling service from wasting resources on doomed requests.
**States of a Circuit Breaker:**
    **Closed**: The circuit is normal. Requests go through to the service. If the failure rate exceeds a certain threshold, the circuit trips to Open.
    **Open**: The circuit is broken. All requests to the service immediately fail (or return a fallback response) without actually calling the service. After a configurable timeout, it transitions to Half-Open.
    **Half-Open**: A limited number of test requests are allowed to pass through to the service.
    If these test requests succeed, the circuit goes back to Closed.
    If they fail, the circuit returns to Open for another timeout period.
**Why it's useful in Node.js:**
Node.js applications are often event-driven and perform I/O-bound operations. Making network requests to other microservices is a common I/O operation. A failing dependency can quickly block the Node.js event loop if not handled gracefully, leading to degraded performance or unresponsiveness of your service. Implementing a circuit breaker ensures your Node.js service remains resilient.
**Node.js Implementation:**
While you could implement a circuit breaker manually, it's generally recommended to use battle-tested libraries. The most popular one in Node.js is opossum.
