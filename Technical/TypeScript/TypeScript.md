**Introduction to TypeScript**
    > TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, adding type safety and static checking.
    > It's not a new language or a replacement for JavaScript, but a development tool that helps catch errors during coding rather than at runtime.
    > All TypeScript code compiles to JavaScript, which runs in browsers or Node.js.
    > Typscript is all about type saftey.
    > typescript is development tool. it helps you to write better code with less problem with more scalable and maintablable code that is easily understandable and produces less error
    **Setting Up TypeScript**
        **Two ways to install:**
            > globally for practice (using npm install -g typescript), and as a dev dependency in a project.
            > Use the TSC (TypeScript compiler) command to transpile .ts files to .js.
    **Types**   
        1) number
        2) string
        3) boolean
        4) null, undefined, void
        5) Arrays and objects
        6) Special types: any, never, unknown  
    **Syntax**  
        `let VariableName : type = value;`
    **Note** : TypeScript can infer types when you immediately assign a value, so you don't always need explicit annotations.
