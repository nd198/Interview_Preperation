When you run the npm i (or its longer form npm install) command, it interacts with and potentially updates two key files in your project's root directory: package.json and package-lock.json. These files work together to manage your project's dependencies

**Here's a breakdown of what happens to each file:**
**package-lock.json**
This file is the most directly impacted by npm i. The package-lock.json is automatically generated or updated any time npm modifies the node_modules directory or the package.json file.[3][4]
    **Primary Role:** Its main purpose is to "lock" the versions of all your project's dependencies, including sub-dependencies (dependencies of your dependencies).[5][6] It records the exact version of every package that was installed.
    **Guarantees Consistency:** This ensures that every developer on a team, as well as deployment and continuous integration systems, will install the exact same versions of all dependencies.[1][3] This creates reproducible builds and helps avoid the "it works on my machine" problem.[1][5]
    **Installation Driver:** When you run npm i, npm will first look for package-lock.json.[6][8] If it exists, npm will use the exact versions specified in this file to download and install packages, ignoring the potentially broader version ranges in package.json.[3][9]
    **Performance and Security:** By having a locked dependency tree, npm can often speed up the installation process.[3][5] It also contains integrity hashes for each package, which helps verify that the downloaded packages haven't been tampered with.[10]

    In essence, package-lock.json is a snapshot of your node_modules directory. It's highly recommended to commit this file to your version control system (like Git) to ensure everyone has the same setup.

**package.json**
This file is your project's manifest. You often edit this file manually, but npm i can also modify it in certain situations. 
    **Primary Role**: It contains metadata about your project, such as its name and version, and lists the direct dependencies (dependencies) and development-only dependencies (devDependencies) your project needs.
    **Flexible Versioning**: In package.json, you can specify a version range for your dependencies using semantic versioning (e.g., ^18.2.0 or ~1.2.3). This tells npm that it's okay to install newer minor or patch versions of a package.
    **When npm i Updates It**:
        > If you install a new package using a command like npm install express --save-prod (or -P), npm will add "express" to the dependencies section of your package.json.[12] The --save-prod is now the default behavior for npm install <package-name>.
        
        > If you use the --save-dev (or -D) flag, like npm install jest --save-dev, the package will be added to the devDependencies section.[12][14]

**In summary, when you run npm i:**
    > npm reads package-lock.json first to ensure a deterministic and reproducible installation of dependencies into the node_modules folder.

    > If you're installing a new package, npm will update package.json to add the new dependency.
    package-lock.json is then updated to reflect the exact state of the node_modules directory after the installation.
